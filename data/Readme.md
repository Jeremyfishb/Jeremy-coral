Here is where I will save data or put links to data

# Raw data files

The raw data output from MS is saved in these directories in the UW department of Genome Science cluster, accessed using the Putty command line.

The outer matrix .raw files are here:
nexus1 /net/nunn/vol1/jeremy/2018_March_9_JPG_corals/coral_outer

The inner matrix samples .raw files are here:
nexus1 /net/nunn/vol1/brook/2018_March_9_JPG_corals/coral_inner_matrix

The rerun inner matrix .raw samples are here:
nexus1 /net/nunn/vol1/brook/2018_March_9_JPG_corals/coral_inner_matrix/Rerun_SOM_samples


A master spreadsheet that identifies the MS raw output sample id to the coral sample is in this directory: 
~/Documents/GitHub/Jeremy-coral/data
