# Jeremy-coral

## Project info
This is my repository for Bioinformatics class where I will analyze proteomics data from a coral bleaching project.

For this project, I will compare the relative protein expression level, and types of proteins expressed, between coral tissue and coral skeletal material in bleached and non-bleached corals. 

## Repository info
This repository includes files for data (which may actually be stored in the genome science cluster), analyses and scripts. Analyses should contain the results of analyses and scripts should contain the commands used to organize, examine and analyze the protein data. The analyses and scripts files may also contain sub-folders for different programs used to run programs and scripts (e.g. R, Jupyter, Putty, etc.).

## Plans for coming weeks
(week 4 and week 5)

This week, I hope to meet with one of my collaborators, Brook Nunn, to figure out how to access my data from the genome science cluster. It has been moved from it's previous directory to one that I do not have access to. I will also discuss with Brook what steps to take next, but here is what I envision:

Get access to a copy of the original data set. I will re-run .raw files with Comet to convert them to .pep.xml files. Then I will analyze those files using Peptideprophet and Proteinprophet. From there, I should be able to do some quality checks of the data and download spreadsheets of peptide and protein data. After that, I am not yet sure what needs to be done and will discuss this with Brook.
